Me vs The World Chess Web App

## Project Intent

This is an asynchronous “me vs the world” chess project:
- One human host plays via emailed move links
- Visitors collectively play the opposing side
- Only one visitor move is accepted per turn
- CAPTCHA is required for visitor submissions
- Host color flips every completed game
- Display algebraic notation of previous moves
