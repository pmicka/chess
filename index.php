/**
 * Me vs the World Chess — Public Game Page
 *
 * Intent:
 * - This is the public-facing page where visitors collectively play against the host.
 * - Visitors may submit a move ONLY when it is the visitors' turn.
 * - Visitor move submission is gated by CAPTCHA to reduce spam/bot abuse.
 *
 * High-level flow:
 * 1) Load current game state from /api/state.php (FEN/PGN/turn/status).
 * 2) Render a board UI and allow interaction only for the visitor side.
 * 3) Use chess.js client-side to prevent obviously illegal moves.
 * 4) On submit:
 *    - Include CAPTCHA token + updated FEN/PGN + move notation
 *    - POST to /api/visitor_move.php
 *
 * Security model (MVP):
 * - Client-side legality checks are helpful but not authoritative.
 * - Server MUST enforce turn order and single-move acceptance (locking).
 * - Server verifies CAPTCHA and rejects out-of-turn or duplicate submissions.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The host plays asynchronously via emailed, single-use links (see my_move.php).
 * - Host color flips each completed game (implemented server-side).
